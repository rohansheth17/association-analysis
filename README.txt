To run Jupyter python notebook Apriori.ipynb, please run the first seven blocks of code in sequence.
In the eighth block, you can type the support value as the second argument to the function oneCset(a,sc).
In the next block, you can again type the support value as the third argument to the function jointSet(a,length,sc).
Then run the next two blocks (blocks 10 and 11). In block 12, you can type the confidence value as the argument to the function ruleGen(minconf).
Then you can run the rest of the blocks in sequence. Thank you.
